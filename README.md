# Tellagen Plugins for Claude Code

Official plugin marketplace for [Tellagen](https://tellagen.com) — investigate incidents with AI, post structured findings, and build incident timelines.

## Install

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add tellagen/tellagen-marketplace
/plugin install tellagen
```

Then add your credentials to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "TELLAGEN_API_KEY": "tllg_your_key_here",
    "TELLAGEN_API_URL": "https://mycompany.api.tellagen.com"
  }
}
```

If you already have other settings in `~/.claude/settings.json`, merge the `env` block into your existing file.

### Claude Desktop

Add the Tellagen MCP server to your Claude Desktop config:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tellagen": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@tellagen/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "TELLAGEN_API_KEY": "tllg_your_key_here",
        "TELLAGEN_API_URL": "https://mycompany.api.tellagen.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you already have other MCP servers configured, merge the `tellagen` entry into your existing `mcpServers` object.

### Get your API key

1. Go to [app.tellagen.com](https://app.tellagen.com) → **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Create a key with `incidents:read` and `incidents:write` scopes
3. Copy the key (starts with `tllg_`) and your workspace API URL

## What's included

- **Tellagen MCP server** (`@tellagen/mcp-server`) — 12 tools for reading incidents, running investigations, posting findings, and promoting to timelines
- **Investigation skill** (`/tellagen:investigate`) — structured workflow that walks Claude through a full incident investigation (Claude Code only)

## Usage

Run the investigation skill in any project (Claude Code only):

```
/tellagen:investigate
```

Or ask Claude directly (both Claude Code and Claude Desktop):

```
Investigate incident #42 on Tellagen
```

- **GitHub** — check recent deploys, read diffs, search code
- **PagerDuty** — alert history, escalation details
- **Sentry** — error groups, stack traces
- **Kubernetes** — pod restarts, OOMKills, events

No extra configuration on the Tellagen side — just install the vendor MCP servers and Claude uses them.
